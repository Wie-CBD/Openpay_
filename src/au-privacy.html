                            <p>We collect, hold, use and disclose personal information to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>confirm your identity and credit worthiness and to process credit applications you make;</li>

                                <li>comply with our legal and regulatory obligations; and</li>
                                <li>otherwise to manage our business.</li>

                            </ol>
                            <p>The types of persons, agencies and entities we typically disclose personal information to include (but are not limited to):</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>our suppliers, contractors (such as any mail house), organisations that provide us with technical and support services and our professional advisors;</li>

                                <li>our related entities (who may use and disclose the information in the same manner we can); and</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>We may also discloser your personal information in accordance with any consent you give or where disclosure is authorised, compelled or permitted by law.</p>
                            <p>If we disclose information to a third party, we generally require that the third party protect your information to the same extent that we do.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Credit providers and credit reporting bodies</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>We may exchange your credit-related personal information (including your credit worthiness or credit history) with credit reporting bodies (<strong>CRBs</strong>) and with other credit providers. We exchange this credit-related personal information to assess an application by you for credit and to notify CRBs and other credit providers of a serious credit infringement or default by you. We may disclose your information to any person reasonably necessary for the purposes of that person taking an assignment of your loan.</p>
                            <p>The CRBs we use are Dun &amp; Bradstreet (Australia) Pty Ltd and Veda Advantage Ltd, whose privacy policy and contact details are set out at www.dnb.com.au and www.veda.com.au.</p>
                            <p>You can ask a CRB not to use or disclose credit information it holds about you for a period of 21 days (called a ‘ban period’) without your consent if you believe on reasonable grounds that you have been or are likely to be a victim of fraud, including identity fraud.&nbsp; You agree to us accessing your personal information (including credit-related information) held with a CRB, even if there is a ban period in place, for the purposes of assessing an application for credit or to collect overdue payments.</p>
                            <p>CRBs may use the credit-related personal information they hold to respond to requests from us or other credit providers to ‘pre-screen’ you for direct marketing.&nbsp; You can ask a CRB not to do this.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Protection of personal information</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>We will hold personal information as either secure physical records, electronically on our intranet system, in cloud storage, and in some cases, records on third party servers, which may be located overseas.</p>
                            <p>We use a range of security measures to protect the personal information we hold, including by ensuring that data centres are subject to identity and access management and employees and third parties are subject to information security obligations.</p>
                            <p>We will destroy or de-identify personal information once it is no longer needed for a valid purpose or required to be kept by law.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Direct marketing</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Like most businesses, marketing is important to our continued success. &nbsp;We therefore like to stay in touch with customers and let them know about new offers and opportunities. &nbsp;We may provide you with information about products, services and promotions either from us, or from third parties which may be of interest to you.</p>
                            <p>You may opt out at any time if you no longer wish to receive direct marketing messages from us. &nbsp;You can make this request by contacting our Privacy Officer.</p>

                            <p>We are not obliged to correct any of your personal information if we do not agree that it requires correction and may refuse to do so.&nbsp; If we refuse a correction request, we will provide you with a written notice stating our reasons for refusing.</p>
